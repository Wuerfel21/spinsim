   These changes fix a problem with the u. word when the MSB is set.

3. Fixed the putch PASM routine so that it only writes P30 in OUTA


                         Changes in pfth 1.02

1. Added ospfth.spin, which runs under Spinix

2. Added support for two simultaneous open files

3. Added bye and reboot words

4. Added sub-directory support

5. Added CD word to change the working directory

6. Modified the s" word to work in the interpretation mode

7. Added a kernel word to make constants and values more efficient


                         Changes in pfth 1.00

1. Fixed the FOR and NEXT words

2. Fixed a bug in UNLOOP

3. Added create-file, file-write, file-line, file-flush, file-close and
   delete-file

4. Added linux.fth that implements simple ls, rm, cp and cat commands

5. Added sdutils.fth that contains some file utilities

6. Added TED -- a tiny text editor

7. Changed SAVE to EESAVE in i2c.fth


                         Changes in pfth 0.89

1. Changed the dictionary word structure to use 16-bit pointers instead of 32
   bits.

2. Changed the execution list in compiled words to use 16-bit execution tokens
   instead of 32 bits.

3. Changed the positions of the code pointer and DOES pointer to make the inner
   loop more efficient.  It now runs about 25% faster.

4. Changed SEE back to printing "_lit" for numbers.

5. Implemented a _loop kernel word to make DO-LOOP faster.


                         Changes in pfth 0.83

1. Changed SEE in see.fth so that it doesn't print "_lit" for numbers

2. Added bufser.fth that contains a buffered serial driver

3. Added a BUFFERIT word in bufser.fth that reads the serial input into memory
   until it encounters an "ESC" character.

4. Added an EVALBUF word in bufser.fth that will evaluate multiple lines in a
   memory buffer

5. Updated the readme.txt file with text contributed by Loopy

6. Updated the readme.txt file with a description of the dictionary word format

7. Added a SAVE word to i2c.fth that will write the current hub RAM image to
   EEPROM.  Note: The small Spin program at the end of memory must have been
   preserved for this to boot properly.

8. Changed the CR word so that it emits both a carriage return and a line feed.

9. Added CASE, ENDCASE, OF and ENDOF to init.fth

10. Improved WAITCNT and MS in propwords.fth.  Removed INA!

11. Fixed LIST-FILES in sd.fth to skip over deleted files in the directory

12. Changed the execution token so that it points to the code pointer instead
    of the beginning of the word in the dictionary

13. Made KEY a deferred word so that it can be re-assigned to the serial input
    after reading the FILEs in memory
